  I am a senior software engineer specializing in DevOps for AI applications.
  <br><br> 
  At MathWorks UK, I work on the Parallel Computing Toolbox team, enhancing the testing infrastructure for MATLAB's GPU software, particularly in deep learning. My role includes reducing technical debt, improving GPU acceleration support, and expanding my data science expertise to drive innovation and quality in software testing.
  <br><br>
  I hold a PhD in Electronic Engineering from Imperial College London, where I optimized sparse linear algebra algorithms for GPUs.
